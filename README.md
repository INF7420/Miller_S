# My INF 7420 Project

## Wireframes

To proficiently build my fictional Library IT Support company website, I have developed multiple wireframes. These multiple wireframes were created in order to help shape the content of the company and develop a consistent structure to display the content across all of the website pages.

The proposed layouts are chic and sophisticated to engage the user and have an optimal easy navigation around the company’s website.
## Home Page
The Home page is the main page of the company’s website. This page will provide the user an overview of the company and services offered.
